# CS-210-Project-Two-Airgead-Banking

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * The purpose of this project was to create a program for our client, Airgead Banking, to demonstrate to high school students the difference in overall investment growth with -and- without a monthly deposit into that investment account.

### What did you do particularly well?
  * I feel that I created a simple, yet intuitive program that achieved the desired outcomes and calculations with an output that was easy to read and understand.

### Where could you enhance your code?
  * I struggled with getting the dollar signs [$] to show in a manner that kept them aligned with the number values. I seached and searched for coding suggestions across numerous resources, but I never could get it to work quite like I wanted. Ultimately, I ended up leaving the [$] out of the final outputs. The lack of [$] not being there doesn't necessarily distract from the overall output, but it was just a "nerd-in-me" moment that wanted to get it exactly right and I couldn't.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
  * Getting the calculations just right was a bit of a challenge. I overcame this through a lot of trial and error (a lot of error) :-). I also consulted resources from stackoverflow.com, youtube.com, cplusplus.com to name a few. Byond that, I referenced back to the original project doucmentation to make sure that the output was as expected.
  * Beyond the calculations, I struggled a bit to get the "tables" within the output to line up the way I wanted. Again, once I could get the desired output, getting it lined-up was mostly just some trial and error.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  * As with much of the programming assignments/projects in this course, the OOP concepts will be most transferrable and applicable to future work. Encapsulating the calculations and outputs into varous methods and functions is an overall theme of OOP concepts and general programming efficiency.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * Easy readability and maintenance was achieved through the various functions and methods. In-line comments were included throughout to enhance understanding and maintenance of the code.
