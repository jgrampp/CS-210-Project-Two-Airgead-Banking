### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * The purpose of this project was to create a program for our client, Airgead Banking, to demonstrate to high school student the difference in overall investment growth with -and- without a monthly deposit into that investment account.

### What did you do particularly well?
  * I feel that I created a simple, yet intuitive program that achieved the desired outcomes and calculations with an output that was easy to read and understand.

### Where could you enhance your code?
  * I struggled with getting the dollar signs ($) to show in a manner that kept them aligned with the number values. I seached and searched for coding suggestions across numerous resources, but I never cold get it to work quite like I wanted. Ultimately, I left the ($) out of the final outputs. The lack of ($) not being there doesn't necessarily distract from the overall output, but it was just a "nerd in me" moment that wanted to get it exactly right and I couldn't.

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
  * Getting the calculations just right was a bity of a challenge. I overcame this through a lot of trial and error (a lot of error) :-). I also consulted resources from stackoverflow.com, youtube.com, cplusplus.com to name a few. Byond that, I referenced back to the original porject doucment to make sure that the output was as expected.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?


### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
